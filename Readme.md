# TOD Markets API Examples

This repository contains example code for interacting with the TOD Markets API. The examples demonstrate how to authenticate, retrieve market data, and place orders using various programming languages.

The examples are intended for educational purposes and should be adapted to fit your specific use cases and requirements.

## Getting Started

Visit the [TOD Markets API Documentation (Postman)](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/36349395/2sA3XQi2Vb) to learn more about the available endpoints and how to use them.


## The Examples

The examples are organized into folders based on the programming language used. Each folder contains code snippets and instructions for setting up and running the examples.

You can make use of the provided `.env.example` file to configure your environment variables, such as your API key and domain URL.

We recommend testing with the staging environment before deploying to production. The staging domain URL is `https://staging.todmarkets.com.au/api/`.
